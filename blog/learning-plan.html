            <h3 class="main-subtitle">expectations</h3>
            <p>My longest-term goal is build a start-up company relating to the Tech Industry (preferably Augmented Reality). Before I do this, I want to be employed as a React Developer to help build forward thinking applications. I want to be a part of serious change in this industry.<br>
              My biggest weakness is my memory and lack of understand in my learning ability. I am unsure on my best method to learn but have been working on multiple ways to do so. My biggest strength is now my presentence and honesty. I am also a great communicator. I am always happy with discussions since I enjoy understanding how others think. <br><br>
              I want to develop learning methods to manage and organise new concepts and learning materials (I want to learn how to learn). I would love to develop my time management skills in order to meet deadlines while having confidence in the work. I would also want to develop how to prioritise my workload efficiently. I will love to be more confident in asking for help when I get stuck. <br>
              I expect the team to understand the amount of growth I am going through and to adjust teaching styles when I still don't get it (after the 5th time explaining it). I expect them to support and discuss the topics in depth with me so I am able to fully grasp the concepts. I also expect no judgement when I fully get stuck and frustrated.</p>

          <p>I will coordinate with my facilitator to work out what works needs prioritising over others. I will work as closely to a timebox to ensure I hit deadlines. I will be practicing mindfulness to better understand myself and others.<br>
            I will ask questions every time I do not understand. I will push myself to get out of the mindset that I am asking dumb questions. I will coordinate with team mates and facilitators to figure out a method to work around road blocks.<br>
            I commit to not letting my pride of figuring stuff on my own over take the ability to ask for help. To ask classmates and facilitators for help before spending hours stuck in a google rabbit-hole.

          <h3 class="main-subtitle"<h3>acknowledgments</h3>
          <p> I would like to say a quick thank you to the Dev Academy facilitators and all my classmates that are embarking on this journey with me.<br>
            I am so grateful to have this opportunity and the amount of support that comes with it. I am truly feeling the love, I thought I should share some back with you all! xx
