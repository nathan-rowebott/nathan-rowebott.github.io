					<h4>IQ Scale</h4>
					<p>
						Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is a measure of a persons ability to think logically.
						Examples of these are problem-solving skills or how well they understand and communicate
						complex ideas. The measurement is in the form of a number, this is calculated from
						taking special IQ exams done by trained professionals.

					<p>
						A high IQ score does not always mean that a person will have a successful life. Nor does
						a low IQ score determine a persons lack of success. It is just a show of how certain
						individuals handle mental challenges.

					<h4>Main Differences between IQ and EQ</h4>
					<p>
						Here we can see that the main difference between the two is that IQ is based on the
						individual and their own mental environments, where EQ is based not only on the
						individual, but the environment that surrounds them.
					</p>

					<p>
						Having a balance of both Intelligences will give the individual a set of skills that
						will improve the health of themselves and the relationships they hold.
					</p>
					<p>
						I will be practicing a lot of techniques relating to EQ. I struggled a lot with taking
						care of myself and putting people ahead of me. I am now developing at an exponential
						rate and will continue on this path. I will strive to be the best version of myself and
						will appreciate all the support that comes my way.
