					<h3>mind vs. brain</h3>
					<h4>How has neuroplasticity influenced my learning?</h4>
					<p>
						I never really understood my brain until I learnt about Neuroplasticity. I am not sure if I am the
						only one. I never questioned exactly why, learning about some topics I understand quickly, but
						then some, no matter how much time I pour into understanding it, I still didn't get it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Neuroplasticity is the term referring to the brain's ability to modify, change structure, and
						function from experiences gained throughout one's life. There are multiple techniques to build
						stronger hardier neural networks. Some common practices for strengthening connections are;
						constantly repeating a task, reading, sleeping, and even dancing!

					<p>
						Learning about neuroplasticity, I now understand that everyone's brains are wired uniquely. No one
						will have the same wiring since no two people undergo the same experiences in the same way. Each
						person builds different connections for every experience, they experience. The more time we spend
						thinking about

							>Because of the power of neuroplasticity, you can, in fact, reframe your world and rewire your
							brain so that you are more objective. You have the power to see things as they are so that you
							can respond thoughtfully, deliberately, and effectively to everything you experience.<br />

					<h3>fixed vs. growth</h3>
					<h4>Travelling from a dark past to a now glowing future</h4>
					<p>
						<span>This concept is super new to me. </span><br />
						To be honest, I have been living with a few fixed mindset traits for a while. At first I felt
						shame, but now I feel relieved that I have come to realise what I need to work on. I now
						understand that neuroplasticity has enabled me to believe I can change the wiring in my brain to
						think and perform better and with more positivity and perseverance.

					<p>
						This topic has created a new respect for myself. I am going to set a goal for growing my mindset.
						I want to be able to perform and communicate better. I am proud of how far I have come and I'm
						eager to find out how much further I can go.

							>"It’s critical to reward not just effort but learning and progress, and to emphasize the
							processes that yield these things, such as seeking help from others, trying new strategies, and
							capitalizing on setbacks to move forward effectively. In all of our research, the outcome — the
							bottom line — follows from deeply engaging in these processes." <br />
