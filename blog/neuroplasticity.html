					<h4>How has neuroplasticity influenced my learning?</h4>
					<p>
						I never really understood my brain until I learnt about Neuroplasticity. I am not sure
						if I am the only one. I never questioned exactly why, learning about some topics I
						understand quickly, but then some, no matter how much time I pour into understanding it,
						I still didn't get it.

						Neuroplasticity is the term referring to the brain's ability to modify, change

						Learning about neuroplasticity, I now understand that everyone's brains are wired
						uniquely. No one will have the same wiring since no two people undergo the same
						experiences in the same way. Each person builds different connections for every
						experience, they experience. The more time we spend thinking about
