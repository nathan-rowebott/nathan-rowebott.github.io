          <h4>Why is JavaScript so important?</h4>
          <p>
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript band together to make up the 'Living
            Creatures of the Internet'. We hold the power to play God in this
            virtual world.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML, the skeleton (or exoskeleton), CSS, the appearance of skin (or
            fur), and JavaScript, the brain, muscles, and organs.
          </p>
          <p>
            When only using HTML & CSS, they form landscapes and terrains â€” but
            combined with the magic of JavaScript. The beginning of lifeforms
            emerge.

          <h3 class="main-subtitle">control flow & loops</h3>
          <h4>Control Flow</h4>
          <p>
            Control Flow is the process of determining the correct order at
            which the functions will be executed. The Brain sends signals to the
            muscles when its decided to move. Once the muscle receives the
            signal, it moves. It is unable to move before the signal gets there
            because the brain controls on the flow of the signal, not the
            muscle.
          </p>
          <h4>Loops</h4>
          <p>
            Loops are an element that repeats a portion of code a set number of
            times until the desired process is complete. Repetitive tasks are
            common in programming, and loops are essential to save time and
            minimize errors.

          <h3 class="main-subtitle">arrays & objects</h3>
          <h4>Arrays</h4>
          <p>
            Arrays are like your weekly calendar. There is a process for how you
            go about your week. Monday-Sunday. You can add content to a day but
            each of these days has an index and it will always follow a
            zero-based pattern, meaning Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6.
          </p>
          <h4>Objects</h4>
          <p>
            Objects are like shopping lists or bucket list. They follow no
            order, only what you need or what you want. You can write whatever
            but it has to use references assigned to values in order to hold the
            information.

          <h3 class="main-subtitle">functions</h3>
          <h4>A Building Block</h4>
          <p>
            Functions are the muscles and organs of the 'Living Internet
            Creatures'. The muscles are what give the body movement, they follow
            a series of instructions so that they can perform the task. The
            organs also has sets of instructions depending on what is needed
            from them. Each having a key role to play the functions work so that
            the 'Creature' can 'Live'.

          <h3 class="main-subtitle">the dom & devtools</h3>
          <h4>The DOM</h4>
          <p>
            The DOM, also know as the Document Object Model. This is the plain
            at which all virtual life exists. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript live
            here to create a home for the 'Creatures'. Though only JavaScript
            can make changes to it's behaviour and creating a reactive platform
            for the Gods to interact with.
          </p>

          <h4>DevTools</h4>
          <p>
            Chrome DevTools is your tool belt. When working on the job, we need
            tools on-the-fly. DevTools allows us to hold certain powers so that
            we may control the lands and all it's 'Creatures'. The wizard has
            grants us such power comes from this U R L, you must give thanks,
            https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/ . HaZza!
