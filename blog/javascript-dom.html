					<h4>Why is JavaScript so important?</h4>
					<p>
						HTML, CSS, and JavaScript band together to make up the 'Living Creatures of the
						Internet'. We hold the power to play God in this virtual world.
					</p>
					<p>
						HTML, the skeleton (or exoskeleton), CSS, the appearance of skin (or fur), and
						JavaScript, the brain, muscles, and organs.
					</p>
					<p>
						When only using HTML & CSS, they form landscapes and terrains â€” but combined with the
						magic of JavaScript. The beginning of lifeforms emerge.

					<h3 class="main-subtitle">control flow & loops</h3>
					<h4>Control Flow</h4>
					<p>
						Control Flow is the process of determining the correct order at which the functions will
						be executed. The Brain sends signals to the muscles when its decided to move. Once the
						muscle receives the signal, it moves. It is unable to move before the signal gets there
						because the brain controls on the flow of the signal, not the muscle.
					</p>
					<h4>Loops</h4>
					<p>
						Loops are an element that repeats a portion of code a set number of times until the
						desired process is complete. Repetitive tasks are common in programming, and loops are
						essential to save time and minimize errors.

					<h3 class="main-subtitle">arrays & objects</h3>
					<h4>Arrays</h4>
					<p>
						Arrays are like your weekly calendar. There is a process for how you go about your week.
						Monday-Sunday. You can add content to a day but each of these days has an index and it
						will always follow a zero-based pattern, meaning Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6.
					</p>
					<h4>Objects</h4>
					<p>
						Objects are like shopping lists or bucket list. They follow no order, only what you need
						or what you want. You can write whatever but it has to use references assigned to values
						in order to hold the information.
					</p>

					<h3 class="main-subtitle">functions</h3>
					<h4>A Building Block</h4>
					<p>
						Functions are the muscles and organs of the 'Internet Creatures'. The muscles are what
						give the body movement, they follow series of instructions so that they can perform the
						task. The organs also has sets of instructions depending on what is needed from them.
						Each having a key role to play, the functions work so that the 'Creature' can finally
						'Live'.

					<h3 class="main-subtitle">the dom & devtools</h3>
					<h4>The DOM</h4>
					<p>
						The DOM, also know as the Document Object Model. Is the plain on which all virtual life
						exists. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript live here to create a home for the 'Creatures'. Though
						only JavaScript can make changes to it's behaviour for in turn, creates a reactive
						platform for the Gods to interact with.
					</p>

					<h4>DevTools</h4>
					<p>
						Chrome DevTools is your tool belt. When working on the job site, we need our tools
						on-the-fly. DevTools allows us to hold certain powers so that we may control the land
						and all the 'Creatures' inside it. The wizard that grants us such power comes from this
						U R L, we must give thanks,
