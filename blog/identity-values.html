              <h3 class="main-subtitle">identity & values</h3>
              <p> Writing this has been the 2nd hardest task I have had to do this year. <br>
                Core values, for me, never existed. I lived my entire adult life doing everything I wanted. I respected everyone but I did not spend time thinking about how my actions affected friends and family. As long as I was staying "happy", life was fine.
                Until it was not. <br>
                It was probably the 50th day in a row living like an owl. Staying up all night, getting high, and gaming with my so-called "friends" that I had never met, and who were living in America and UK. I missed every social gathering I had originally said yes to. Said no to every family event.  By this time, I didn't realise that I had cut so many people out of my life. My mind was only being engulfed by substances.
                It had just become normal to be alone. <br>
                When I met my (current) partner. I realised that I had become so toxically self-absorbed, I was trading a life-long connection with an abusive substance. I then made a promise to myself that I would change, and become the best version possible.<br> 
                This is when my core values of compassion and integrity came to light. <br> 
                If I stayed the same, I would lose them, and I was not going to let that happen. I got clean and sober. I got a full time job. I committed to everything that has come my way and I have not looked back since.
                The old me was caught up doing everything on my own. If I couldn't do it, I didn't deserve it. I felt too proud ( and stupid ) to ask for help. The male culture that I grew up around was the "men don't talk about their feelings" status. As well spending so many years away from Aeteoroa, I never felt like I connected to my birth right as a Maori. I dont speak Te Reo, it is something I hope to learn further on in my life.</p>

            <h3 class="main-subtitle">strengths and weaknesses</h3>
            <p>After being diagnosed with Adult ADHD, a lot of my behaviors started to make sense. I thought it was my greatest weakness, but turns out, it might be my greatest strength. <br>
              This is when the value of enthusiasm entered my life. <br>
              Throughout my adult life I have gained a very good sense of urgency (even though I am still getting used to this whole Time Boxing thing) and a hunger for collaborating in a team. I prefer bouncing ideas off of team members and find this to be very effective when problem solving. <br>
              My biggest limitation is that I am easily overwhelmed with stress and self doubt (also drug abuse means my memory is sometimes not the best ). These, I am working very hard to overcome. <br>
              I think my strengths will help me as there is a lot of pressure to hit deadlines. The projects in the bootcamp are mostly collaboration based which means I am excited to work in a group of like minded people. <br>
              An example of unproductive productivity? I used to work at a vineyard in a big team of migrant workers. Each member of a different nationality would have their own values, native language, culture, and/or mindset. Without preparing a team new member with the basic work cultures that we have here in Aoteoroa, it would make it difficult to communicate, share roles, or express opinions. Everyone is different and I love and respect that, but sometimes there needs to be set of basic principles everyone understands and abides by. No matter the cultural differences. <br>
              To get past the differences, I made time to relate to each person. I used to live in tiny country in South East Asia called Brunei. As a third-culture-kid, not fitting in was my speciality. I would use this to bring team members together. <br>
              My only other way I would think about solving conflicts would be to ask the person what their thoughts are, bounce of them, and come to a solution.</p>
