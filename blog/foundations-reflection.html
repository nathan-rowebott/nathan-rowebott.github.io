					<h3>top 3 findings</h3>
					<h4>How much I grow when I am vulnerable</h4>
					<p>
						At the start of this course, I promised myself that THIS, new, journey I was embarking
						on, was to better myself in every aspect. I feel I have done this, or at least, I think
						I have. My physical body is not in amazing shape. Lockdown sure does make me eat. But, I
						love it and I love myself.
					</p>
					<p>
						Being able to express my own doubts has been a struggle for me. I was always intimidated
						when I felt looked down on but the core reflections allowed me to not feel singled out.
						It kept me embracing that I am part of something bigger than my own worries.
					</p>
					<h4>Wait... My brain can change?</h4>
					<p>
						Neuroplasticity has saved my life. Growth mindset has saved my life. Being able to feel
						like I am not a lost cause has saved my life. I am so thankful for the lessons on these
						topics. I have always thought that I could only have a finite amount of knowledge. How
						wrong I was.
					</p>
					<p>
						Even if I am not able to understand or use everything I now learn I am not scared or
						intimidated because I don't know it, YET, but I will know it soon. Having that amount of
						confidence in my abilities has shaped me to be more accepting of challenges and
						obstacles that occur.
					</p>
					<h4>I can actually stick to a plan?!</h4>
					<p>
						Woah, New'r Me can do THIS?? Crazy. I have kept to my word of asking for help. Maybe not
						as often as I should be, but I still am. This has been a problem I have faced my entire
						life. Thinking I can attack the world on my own without support. Now that I have such an
						incredible support system. I know moving forward in my life is going to be a fun and
						exciting.

					<h3>human skills / programming</h3>
					<h4>Whats the point?</h4>
					<p>
						I honestly know that if we were NOT taught about these super important core human
						skills. I would be struggling, immensely. The topics we covered were life changing. It
						gave me a different way of thinking! It gave me hope that I can be better.
					</p>
					<p>
						Students like me (super inexperienced in programming) would struggle to handle the
						amount of content sheer complexity of the subject. I found that I am able to control my
						stress level better knowing that I am getting better.
					</p>
					<h4>Why code without trying to be a better human?</h4>
					<p>
						All the time I spent researching the core skills, the more confident I felt in my
						ability to grow. If I only learnt programming. I feel like I would still struggle with a
						lot of personal issues. I would also feel very insecure. Not any more though.
					</p>
					<p>
						The understanding of myself is far greater than learning JS fundamentals (still very
						important). I just now know how to handle these situations where I feel 'stupid' but are
						actually just growing new neural pathways.
