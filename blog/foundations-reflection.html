					<h4>How much I grow when I am vulnerable</h4>
					<p>
						At the start of this course, I promised myself that THIS, new, journey I was embarking
						on, was to better myself in every aspect. I feel I have done this, or at least, I think
						I have. My physical body is not in amazing shape. Lockdown sure does make me eat. But, I
						love it and I love myself.
					</p>
					<p>
						Being able to express my own doubts has been a struggle for me. I was always intimidated
						when I felt looked down on but the core reflections allowed me so not feel singled out.
						It kept me embracing that I am part of something bigger than my own worries.
					</p>
					<h4>Wait... My brain can change?</h4>
					<p>
						Neuroplasticity has saved my life. Growth mindset has saved my life. Being able to feel
						like I am not a lost cause has saved my life. I am so thankful for the lessons on these
						topics. I have always thought that I could only have a finite amount of knowledge. How
						wrong I was.
					</p>
					<p>
						Even if I am not able to understand everything I learn or are able to use it. I am not
						scared or intimidated because I don't know it, YET, but I will know it soon. Having that
						amount of confidence in my abilities has shaped me to be more accepting of challenges
						and obstacles that occur.
					</p>
					<h4>I can actually stick to a plan?!</h4>
