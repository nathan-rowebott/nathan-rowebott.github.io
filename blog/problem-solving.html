					<h4>I struggled the most when...</h4>
					<p>
						Completing the JavaScript Katas. In particular, 'JS-Gradebook'. I was unable to get the
						average of a given array. From writing the pseudocode out, I was able to understand the
						flow of the problem. I was still unable to create working code but managed to find a
						solution on the website StackOverflow. I did not use that well of a structure to solve
						this issue, I firstly spent more time trying different random methods than actually
						researching into the problem.

						Since I have researched on problem solving this past week, I have come to the
						realisation that there are many ways to solve problems. Techniques that help amateur
						developers become more efficient at writing code, or at any other problems that a person
						may go through.

							>“If you get stuck, get away from your desk. Take a walk, take a bath, go to sleep,
							make a pie, draw, listen to ­music, meditate, exercise; whatever you do, don't just
							stick there scowling at the problem. But don't make telephone calls or go to a party;
							if you do, other people's words will pour in where your lost words should be. Open a
							gap for them, create a space. Be patient.” <br />

						I am putting these newly found techniques to good use. Not that I have mastered them,
						cause no, I am still a noob. But I have made the promise to keep trying to learn these
						fundamental tools. Right now, my best friends are the DevTools and Pseudocode.

					<h3>future</h3>
					<h4>What I hope to be confident in</h4>
					<p>I want to be better at reflecting on what I have accomplished. I want to be able to progress further 
						using the tools of; Pseudocode, Rubber Ducky Method, Googling solutions, and asking my peers / 
						facilitators for help.</p>

					<figure>Fig.3 - My currently direction for improvement</figure>
					<p>Right now I am not the most confident using many of these techniques but I hope to soon. I feel like 
						understanding problem solving is fundamental to the programming world.
