						Completing the JavaScript Katas. In particular, 'JS-Gradebook'. I was unable to get the
						average of a given array. From writing the pseudocode out, I was able to understand the
						flow of the problem. I was still unable to create working code but managed to find a
						solution on the website StackOverflow. I did not use that well of a structure to solve
						this issue, I firstly spent more time trying different random methods than actually
						researching into the problem.

						realisation that there are many ways to solve problems. Techniques that help amateur
						developers become more efficient at writing code, or at any other problems that a person
